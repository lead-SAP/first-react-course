# Disclaimer:
The produced code is a by-product of following Maximilian Schwarzmuller's  React Crash Course for Beginners 2021:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dorf8i6lCuk

All "css" files were copied from the original github repository:
https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/tree/zz-reactjs-summary

On the other hand, all other files were created by following the directions provided in the youtube video. Moreover, errors occured, due to differences in react versions, were solved by looking up similar issues mainly on StackOverFlow.
Another difference is the addition of a "database" folder under the "src" directory with a "database.js" file which contains the "databaseLink()" function that is used in "AllMeetup.js" & "NewMeetup.js" to return the link to the online database - firebase. The contents of the "database.js" file are hidden from public access. Please follow the  instructions in the youtube video linked above for linking firebase to a react project.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
